There are 2 programs-
The first program will generate passwords and store them securely in a file. File cannot  be read until you know the master  password.
The second program will read that file and copy the needed password.

This program uses a mixture of numbers, alphabets and other symbols found on the computer keyboard to form a password which is unpredictable and cannot easily be memorized. 
• Use the random method to select at least one character from each set of characters. 
• Shuffle the password to ensure that the final password does not follow a particular pattern. 
• random, string, pyperclip , os and pickle libraries are used. 
It gives the option to the user whether they want to save the generated password or not. The password is securely saved. The user can get access to the desired password that is kept in the file only if he enters the correct master password.
It is compatible with Python 2.7 version
